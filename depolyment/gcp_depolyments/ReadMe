Prerequisites

•	A Google Cloud Platform account. If you do not have a GCP account, create one now. This tutorial can be completed using only the services included in the GCP free tier.
•	Terraform 0.15.3+ installed locally.

Set up GCP
•	After creating your GCP account, create or modify the following resources to enable Terraform to provision your infrastructure:
•	A GCP Project: GCP organizes resources into projects. Create one now in the GCP console and make note of the project ID. You can see a list of your projects in the cloud resource manager.
•	Google Compute Engine: Enable Google Compute Engine for your project in the GCP console. Make sure to select the project you are using to follow this tutorial and click the "Enable" button.
•	A GCP service account key: Create a service account key to enable Terraform to access your GCP account. When creating the key, use the following settings:
Select the project you created in the previous step.
•	Click "Create Service Account".
•	Give it any name you like and click "Create".
•	For the Role, choose "Project -> Editor", then click "Continue".
•	Skip granting additional users access and click "Done".
•	After you create your service account, download your service account key.

Select your service account from the list.
•	Select the "Keys" tab.
•	In the drop-down menu, select "Create new key".
•	Leave the "Key Type" as JSON.
•	Click "Create" to create the key and save the key file to your system.
